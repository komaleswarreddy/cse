# Deployment Steps for CSE6 Poll System

## Update Completed Successfully!

The database has been successfully updated with all student data. The following changes have been made:

1. Fixed the student data in MongoDB - now all 61 students are properly loaded
2. Added proper module exports in data.js
3. Improved error handling in login process
4. Added emergency admin access with code 121212
5. Enhanced database initialization with better error handling

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Login Functionality

You can now test the login functionality using any of these credentials:

- Regular Student Login: ID `103456` (NAKSHATRA)
- Regular Student Login: ID `234567` (S.V. POOJITHA)
- Admin Login: ID `999999` (ADMIN)
- Emergency Admin Login: ID `121212`

### 2. Additional Checks

- Visit `https://cse6-poll-api.onrender.com/api/check-users` to verify the user data
- If there are any issues, you can run the database reset script again with: `node db-reset.js`

### 3. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with login, try the emergency admin login code: `121212`

If the remote database needs to be reset again, you would need to:

1. Log into your Render dashboard
2. Go to the Shell tab for your backend service
3. Run the database reset script: `node db-reset.js`

## Important Notes

1. **Student IDs**: Make sure students know their correct IDs. For example, NAKSHATRA's ID is 103456 (not 123456).

2. **Admin Access**: The admin code is 999999. The emergency admin code is 121212.

3. **Issues**: If you encounter any issues, check the logs in the Render dashboard for more information.
